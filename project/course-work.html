    <div id="accordion">
    <h3>MATH-UA 122 Calculus II</h3>
    <div id="tabs-1">
      <p>Techniques of integration. Further applications. Plane analytic geometry. Polar coordinates and parametric equations. Infinite series, including power series.</p>
             </div>
     <h3>CS-UY - 2124: Object-oriented Programing</h3>
       <div id="tabs-2">
          <p>This intermediate-level programming course teaches object-oriented programming in C++. Topics: Pointers, dynamic memory allocation and recursion. Classes and objects including constructors, destructors, methods (member functions) and data members. Access and the interface to relationships of classes including composition, association and inheritance. Polymorphism through function overloading operators. Inheritance and templates. Use of the standard template library containers and algorithms.</p>
            </div>
    <h3>MA-UY - 2224: Data Analysis</h3>
      <div id="tabs-3">
          <p>An introductory course to probability and statistics. It affords the student some acquaintance with both probability and statistics in a single term. Topics in Probability include mathematical treatment of chance; combinatorics; binomial, Poisson, and Gaussian distributions; the Central Limit Theorem and the normal approximation. Topics in Statistics include sampling distribution of sample mean and sample variance; normal, t-, and Chi-square distributions; confidence intervals; testing of hypotheses; least squares regression model. Applications to scientific, industrial, and financial data are integrated into the course.</p>
            </div>
    <h3>CS-UY - 2134: Data Structures and Algorithms</h3>
        <div id="tabs-4">
            <p>This course covers abstract data types and the implementation and use of standard data structures. Topics: Fundamental algorithms and the basics of algorithm analysis. A grade of C- or better is required of undergraduate computer science and computer-engineering majors.</p>
              </div>

    <h3>CS-UY - 2214: Computer Architecture and Organization</h3>
        <div id="tabs-5">
          <p>The purpose of the course is to introduce and discuss the structure and operation of digital computers. Topics will include the logic of circuits, microarchitectures, microprogramming, conventional machine architectures, and an introduction to software/hardware interface issues. Assembly language and hardware design programming will be used to demonstrate some of the basic concepts.</p>
              </div>
    
    <h3>MATH-UA - 120: Discrete Mathematics</h3>
        <div id="tabs-6">
          <p>This course is a one-semester introduction to discrete mathematics with an emphasis on the understanding, composition and critiquing of mathematical proofs.</p>
