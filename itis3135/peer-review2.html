      Checklist
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>The design is good as there is good spacing and it is easily readable</li>
      <li>Each page does have a header main and footer</li>
      <li>The header does include name and course but it lacks the brand and added the title of the page</li>
      <li>H2 is used correctly at the start of main on pages</li>
      <li>footer has validation buttons and designed by</li>
    </ol>
    <P>
      I like the breaks in the navigation bar and I think you should add something similar to the header between the different information.
