      Checklist
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>The page design is good as the contrast makes it easy to read and the location of elements and color scheme is repeated </li>
      <li>The header main and footer are included on all pages</li>
      <li>The header has all the needed information and nothing extra</li>
      <li>All the pages use h2 in the main correctly</li>
      <li>footer has all the needed information</li>
    </ol>
  <p>
    I really like the font you used on your homepage and the color scheme of the site.
