        <h3> <a href = "https://samsung.com">Samsung</a> </h3>
        <p>
          The Samsung website displays many of its products.
          <ul>
            <li>Contrast</li>
              The website has a contrast with white and black and it makes everything clear and readable.
            <li>Repetition</li>
              All pages have the same color scheme and share the same header and footer. The headings used on every page also look similar and consistent 
            <li>Alignment</li>
              Everything is aligned.
            <li>Proximity</li>
              Most of the page space is being used and occupied with useful information. The navigation bar is well spaced out to not give a cramped feel.
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h3> <a href = "https://www.art.yale.edu/">Yale Art School</a> </h3>
        <p>
          The website provides information about the Yale School of Art.
          <ul>
            <li>Contrast</li>
              The contrast makes some of the areas of the website hard to read and unpleasent to look at.
            <li>Repetition</li>
              The navigation bar stays in the same spot on all parts of the website but they are many different colors and backgrounds being used.
            <li>Alignment</li>
              Everything is aligned with each other vertically but horizontally it could be aligned better.
            <li>Proximity</li>
              The page is only losing the left side of the page. There is to much of the page not being used, resulting in all the elements being to close to each other.
          </ul>
